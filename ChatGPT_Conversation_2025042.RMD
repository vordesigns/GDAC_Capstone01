##Tim
Hi, earlier, we discussed not get the  rows affected result when using 
R Markdown to execute microsoft sql queries and you provide me with a 
method to get what I was looking for using the following R inline code 
snipped, rows_affected <- dbExecute(con, query)
print(paste(rows_affected, "rows affected")), what would I need to 
provide me with the results of a table or view build query, 
"Commands completed successfully."?

##ChatGPT
Hey Tim! Glad to help out again. You're right — dbExecute() is perfect for 
non-query SQL statements like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE, and it returns 
the number of rows affected.

But if you're running a SQL command like a CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, or 
something similar (DDL or DCL statements), they don’t return result sets 
or affect rows, so dbExecute() returns 0, and there's nothing to print 
except maybe a success confirmation.

If you want a message like "Commands completed successfully.", you can 
add a simple check after running the statement, like this:

```{r}
result <- dbExecute(con, ddl_query)
if (result == 0) {
  print("Commands completed successfully.")
} else {
  print(paste(result, "rows affected."))
}

```

Or even just always print the message regardless of the result if you're 
expecting a DDL/DCL statement:

```{r}
dbExecute(con, ddl_query)
print("Commands completed successfully.")

```

If you want to wrap this more robustly for use inside R Markdown, here's 
a little helper you can use inline or in a chunk:

```{r}
run_query <- function(con, query) {
  tryCatch({
    result <- dbExecute(con, query)
    if (result == 0) {
      message("Commands completed successfully.")
    } else {
      message(result, " rows affected.")
    }
  }, error = function(e) {
    message("Error: ", e$message)
  })
}

# Example usage
run_query(con, "CREATE VIEW my_view AS SELECT * FROM my_table")

```

Let me know if you're running it inline or as a code chunk and want different output formatting!

##Tim
Is this what you mean?

```{r UNCOMMENT QUERY TO USE}
con
query="--USE [GDAC]
--GO

##ChatGPT
Yes, that looks great! You're nearly there — and your code chunk is set up in a very clean and flexible way. Here's just a couple of points to clarify and enhance it depending on how you want it to behave in your R Markdown document:

✅ What You’ve Got
You’ve:

Defined the query as a string (commented-out SQL text).

Defined a run_query() helper function.

Presumably will call run_query(con, query) at some point.

🛠 To Actually Run the Query
Right now, you're only defining the function and the SQL text. If you want to execute the query and show the message ("Commands completed successfully.") in your R Markdown output, just add this at the end of the chunk:

```{r}
run_query(con, query)

```

So the full chunk would look like this:

```{r}
```{r UNCOMMENT QUERY TO USE}
con
query = "-- Your SQL statements here --"

run_query <- function(con, query) {
  tryCatch({
    result <- dbExecute(con, query)
    if (result == 0) {
      message("Commands completed successfully.")
    } else {
      message(result, " rows affected.")
    }
  }, error = function(e) {
    message("Error: ", e$message)
  })
}

run_query(con, query)

```

```{yaml}

---

### 🧠 Notes

1. **Chunk options**: If you want the message to appear in your rendered 
    document, make sure the chunk doesn’t suppress output. Use this at the 
    top of your code block:


```

2. Make sure the SQL isn’t commented out, or dbExecute() won’t run anything. 
    You’ll want to uncomment the SQL statements you actually want executed.

3. Optional logging or printing: You could swap message(...) with cat(...) 
    or print(...) if you want to control how the message appears (e.g., 
    suppress [1] from print() or format output nicely).

Let me know if you'd also like to see how to capture output inline in text 
  or conditionally suppress the command result if you're knitting a report 
  for an audience.

##Tim
Sorry for the confusion, I have commented the code first, because the table 
  is created and loaded with data, and second, because the result set from 
  running this query as is produces the same result and actually running
  this particular query.  Thus, if I ran the query, and got "Commands 
  completed successfully", I would have confirmation that the code works.  
  I haven't tested it yet, just modeled it.

#ChatGPT
Ah, got it now — you're essentially staging a dry run of your R Markdown 
  logic, and the commented SQL is a stand-in for the real thing. You're 
  confirming that when it's time to uncomment and execute, your wrapper 
  (run_query()) will give you the proper success message like "Commands 
  completed successfully." if everything runs as expected.

You're modeling it exactly right.

✅ Summary of What You've Done:
🧪 You're simulating a real execution by setting up the R chunk logic 
    first.

💬 You want that "Commands completed successfully." message as a clear 
    sign the SQL was accepted and processed, especially for DDL like 
    CREATE TABLE.

✅ You're holding off execution until you're ready, but everything is i
    n place.

Once you uncomment the SQL, and run:

```{r}
run_query(con, query)

```

It'll trigger the actual creation (or error), and the message will let 
  you know success without having to sift through verbose console logs 
  or suppressed outputs.

🛠 Tiny Tip for Production Runs
If you're doing this in a reproducible report, you might want a little 
  wrapper like this for optional verbosity:

```{r}
run_query <- function(con, query, label = NULL) {
  tryCatch({
    result <- dbExecute(con, query)
    prefix <- if (!is.null(label)) paste0("[", label, "] ") else ""
    if (result == 0) {
      message(prefix, "Commands completed successfully.")
    } else {
      message(prefix, result, " rows affected.")
    }
  }, error = function(e) {
    message("Error: ", e$message)
  })
}

```

Then you can do:

```{r}
run_query(con, query, label = "Create divvy_trips_xxxx_qx")

```

Just adds a little traceability if you string together several queries in 
  a single document.

Let me know when you run it live — or if you want to also build in logging 
  or result capture!

##Tim
And "run_query(con, query, label = "Create divvy_trips_xxxx_qx")" would be 
  added to the same code chunk, correct?

##ChatGPT
Exactly right — you’d place the run_query(con, query, label = 
  "Create divvy_trips_xxxx_qx") call at the end of the same code chunk 
  where you define the function and the query string.

Here’s the complete structure:


```{r UNCOMMENT QUERY TO USE, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
# Database connection
con

# SQL query (currently commented out for modeling)
query = "--CREATE TABLE or other SQL here--"

# Helper function to run the query and report status
run_query <- function(con, query, label = NULL) {
  tryCatch({
    result <- dbExecute(con, query)
    prefix <- if (!is.null(label)) paste0("[", label, "] ") else ""
    if (result == 0) {
      message(prefix, "Commands completed successfully.")
    } else {
      message(prefix, result, " rows affected.")
    }
  }, error = function(e) {
    message("Error: ", e$message)
  })
}

# Execute the query (this line triggers the action)
run_query(con, query, label = "Create divvy_trips_xxxx_qx")
```

You’ve got it. Once you're ready, just uncomment your actual SQL in the 
  query string, and it’s good to go.

Let me know if you ever want to have it write to a log file or store 
  status messages in a results table. Super easy to expand this!

##Tim
Thank you, this has been very informative, I really appreciate it!

##ChatGPT
You're very welcome, Tim! 😊 I'm glad it was helpful — you’ve got a solid 
  approach going, and it’s clear you’re thinking ahead with structure and 
  clarity.

If you ever want to expand this into a more modular reporting framework 
  (e.g., multiple query steps, logging progress, capturing timestamps, or 
  even generating audit trails), just say the word. You've already laid 
  the groundwork for that kind of thing.

Good luck when you go live with the SQL — I’m here anytime if you hit a 
  snag or want to refine the flow!

##Tim
One more thing, I can use the run_query function to also create data 
  frame, right?  Or should I stick to this for queries where I don't 
  expect to get data sets back only?

##ChatGPT
Ah, excellent question — and you're spot on in your thinking!

🔄 dbExecute() vs dbGetQuery()
The run_query() function as you have it now uses dbExecute(), which is 
  meant for queries that don't return a result set — like:

*CREATE TABLE, DROP, ALTER
*INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

So for queries that return data (like a SELECT), you'll want to use 
  dbGetQuery(), which actually returns a data frame.

✅ Use dbGetQuery() When You Expect a Result Set
Here's how you can create a separate helper to fetch data and put it 
  in a data frame:

```{r}
fetch_data <- function(con, query, label = NULL) {
  tryCatch({
    df <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
    prefix <- if (!is.null(label)) paste0("[", label, "] ") else ""
    message(prefix, "Query executed. ", nrow(df), " rows returned.")
    return(df)
  }, error = function(e) {
    message("Error: ", e$message)
    return(NULL)
  })
}

```

Then you’d use it like:

```{r}
query <- "SELECT * FROM dbo.divvy_trips_xxxx_qx"
df <- fetch_data(con, query, label = "Read test data")

```

✳️ Quick Rule of Thumb

Your Goal	Use This Function
  Run a command, get rows affected	dbExecute()
  Run a query, get result as data.frame	dbGetQuery()
  
So yes — best to stick to run_query() for commands, and use a 
  dedicated fetch_data() when you’re expecting to bring back rows. 
  You could combine them, but separating keeps intent clear and makes 
  debugging easier down the road.

Want me to show you a unified version that handles both, or are you 
happy keeping them separate?

##Tim
I agree with keeping them separate for clarity, even if a function that 
  did both would be nice, I would understand it, but a different data 
  analyst might struggle with it.  

##ChatGPT
Absolutely — that’s a very thoughtful call. 👏

Keeping the `run_query()` for **commands** and `fetch_data()` for 
  **queries** aligns perfectly with the *Principle of Least Surprise*
  — any analyst reading your code will immediately understand what 
  each function is supposed to do.

### 🧠 Why That’s Smart:

- **Separation of concerns** — each function does one thing well.
- **Readability** — other analysts (or future you) don’t have to 
  inspect logic to figure out if a query is supposed to return data 
  or not.
- **Ease of reuse** — clearer function signatures make it easier to 
  use them in automated pipelines or reports.

If you ever work with more junior analysts or hand this off in a 
  shared repo, they'll thank you for not burying conditionals in a 
  catch-all function.

You're building a maintainable data workflow — not just code that 
  works. I love it. 😄

Let me know if you want to make these into a lightweight R package 
  or sourceable `.R` file for reuse!

##Tim
A lightweight R package sounds interesting, what would that entail?

##ChatGPT
Oh now we’re talking! 😄 Making a **lightweight R package** out of 
  utility functions like `run_query()` and `fetch_data()` is a 
  fantastic idea, especially if:

- You want to reuse these functions across multiple projects.
- You collaborate with others and want to share your workflow easily.
- You’re starting to build a toolkit of clean, tested code for 
  R Markdown reporting, database interaction, etc.

---

### 🧰 What It Entails (Overview)

Creating a basic R package is surprisingly straightforward 
  — here’s a high-level breakdown:

---

#### **1. Set Up Package Structure**

The easiest way is with the **`usethis`** and **`devtools`** packages:
```{r}
install.packages("usethis")
usethis::create_package("path/to/myUtilityPkg")

```

This sets up the folder structure with `DESCRIPTION`, `R/`, and so on.

---

#### **2. Add Your Functions**

Put your utility functions in `.R` files inside the `R/` directory.

Example: `R/database_helpers.R`

```{r}
#' Run a non-query SQL command
#' @param con A DBI connection object
#' @param query SQL query as a string
#' @param label Optional label for logging
#' @return NULL, prints message
#' @export
run_query <- function(con, query, label = NULL) {
  tryCatch({
    result <- DBI::dbExecute(con, query)
    prefix <- if (!is.null(label)) paste0("[", label, "] ") else ""
    if (result == 0) {
      message(prefix, "Commands completed successfully.")
    } else {
      message(prefix, result, " rows affected.")
    }
  }, error = function(e) {
    message("Error: ", e$message)
  })
}
```


Same for `fetch_data()`.


```{r}
#' Fetch data from a SQL query
#'
#' @param con A DBI connection object
#' @param query SQL query as a string
#' @param label Optional label for logging
#'
#' @return A data frame containing the result of the query, or NULL on error
#' @export
fetch_data <- function(con, query, label = NULL) {
  tryCatch({
    df <- DBI::dbGetQuery(con, query)
    prefix <- if (!is.null(label)) paste0("[", label, "] ") else ""
    message(prefix, "Query executed. ", nrow(df), " rows returned.")
    return(df)
  }, error = function(e) {
    message("Error: ", e$message)
    return(NULL)
  })
}
```


---

#### **3. Document Functions**

Use **roxygen2-style comments** (like above) to document your functions. 
  Then run:

```{r}
devtools::document()
```


That auto-generates `NAMESPACE` and documentation files.

---

#### **4. Load and Use Your Package Locally**

You can load your dev package like this:

```{r}
devtools::load_all("path/to/myUtilityPkg")
```

And now you can call `run_query()` from anywhere just like a built-in function.

---

#### **5. Optional: Install Locally or Share**

To install it on your system:

```{r}
devtools::install("path/to/myUtilityPkg")
```

To share with others, you can:
- Share the folder as a zip or Git repo
- Host it on GitHub and install with 
    `remotes::install_github("yourusername/myUtilityPkg")`

---

### ✅ Benefits

- Keeps your scripts clean and DRY (don’t repeat yourself).
- Gives you versioning and better testing as your toolkit grows.
- Great foundation if you want to share or teach best practices.

---

Want me to mock up a package folder structure for your two functions 
  as a zip or GitHub-ready folder? Or walk you through turning this 
  into a personal GitHub R package?
  
##Tim
A github friendly structure for both run_query and fetch_data would 
  be awesome, please?
  
##ChatGPT
Here's what I’ve prepared for you:
```{vbnet}
sqlToolsPkg/
├── DESCRIPTION
├── NAMESPACE
├── R/
│   └── database_helpers.R

```

This includes:

*DESCRIPTION: Package metadata
*NAMESPACE: Exports run_query() and fetch_data()
*R/database_helpers.R: Contains both functions, documented with roxygen2

You can now:

  1. Unzip the package below
  2. Open it in RStudio (File → Open Project → Browse to folder)
  3. Run devtools::document() to generate/update documentation
  4. Use devtools::load_all() to test
  5. Push to GitHub using RStudio or Git command line

📦 Download the zip

Let me know if you want:

  *An .Rproj file added for easier RStudio project setup
  *GitHub README.md starter
  *Or a tests/ folder to start unit testing later

You’re well on your way to building a great utility package 
  — this could definitely scale!

##Tim
Thank you, I'll circle back to the .Rproj, README.md, and tests/ since 
  I've already got enough to work on.

##ChatGPT
Sounds like a solid plan, Tim! 💡 You're setting this up exactly right 
  — keeping it lean, focusing on what you need now, and leaving the 
  door open to expand later.

When you're ready to circle back to the `.Rproj`, `README.md`, or 
  test scaffolding, just ping me and I’ll help you scaffold everything 
  cleanly. Enjoy putting the new package to work in your projects — 
  and feel free to share how it goes or if you hit any snags.

Catch you soon, and good luck with the build! 👨‍💻📦

#Python .csv file process change to handle multiple files

##Tim
You provided a python code chunk for R Markdown that added to column 
  names at the top of the file, then two commas on data line, and 
  finally, a hard return at the end of each line.  I need to do this 
  one step to multiple files.  What modifications would I need to 
  make to the following code chunk to achieve this?  Code to follow.

##ChatGPT
Great — go ahead and drop in that code chunk when you're ready, and I’ll walk you through the exact modifications to make it work on multiple files. I’ll help you keep it efficient and tidy. Just send it over!

##Tim
``````{python trying to automate correcting this file for load}

output_path = 'C:\DownloadFile\csv\Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2_PyTgt.csv'
process_csv(input_path, output_path)
```

##ChatGPT
Thanks, Tim! This is a solid script — and to process multiple files 
  with the same logic, you’ll just need to:
1. Loop over a list of input files
2. Generate output file names, or specify them
3. Call process_csv() for each file

Here’s how you can modify your code to do exactly that:

✅ Modified Code: Handle Multiple CSV Files


```{python Modify Multiple CSV Files}
import csv
import re
import os
from pathlib import Path

def clean_numeric_field(value):
    if re.fullmatch(r'"[\d,]+\.\d+"', value) or re.fullmatch(r'"[\d,]+"', value):
        return value.replace(',', '').strip('"')
    return value

def process_csv(input_file, output_file):
    if not os.path.exists(input_file):
        print(f"Input file not found: {input_file}")
        return

    with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as infile, \
         open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8', newline='\n') as outfile:

        reader = csv.reader(infile, delimiter=',', quotechar='"')
        writer = csv.writer(outfile, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)

        headers = next(reader)
        headers += ['NewField1', 'NewField2']
        writer.writerow(headers)

        line_count = 0
        for row in reader:
            cleaned_row = [clean_numeric_field(field) for field in row]
            cleaned_row += ['', '']
            writer.writerow(cleaned_row)
            line_count += 1

        print(f"Processed {line_count} rows. Output saved to: {output_file}")

# === Batch Processing ===

input_dir = Path(r'C:\DownloadFile\csv')
output_dir = input_dir  # Or change to another Path if needed

# List of input files to process
file_names = [
    "Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2_PySrc.csv",
    "Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3_PySrc.csv",
    "Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4_PySrc.csv"
]

# Process each file
for file_name in file_names:
    input_path = input_dir / file_name
    output_name = file_name.replace(".csv", "_PyTgt.csv")
    output_path = output_dir / output_name
    process_csv(str(input_path), str(output_path))

```

🔧 Highlights:
✅ Uses Path from pathlib (handles \ and / safely)

✅ Automatically renames output files from *_PySrc.csv → *_PyTgt.csv

✅ You can add as many filenames to file_names as needed

Let me know if you want it to scan the folder and find all *_PySrc.csv files automatically — I can tweak that next!

##Tim
I note in the file rename function you use  output_name = file_name.replace("_PySrc.csv", "_PyTgt.csv"), If I wanted to append "_PyTgt.csv" to the filename after the original filename but before the ".csv", would I adjust the output_path = statement to "file_name.replace(".csv", "_PyTgt.csv") to achieve this?

##ChatGPT
Yes, you're absolutely right! 🎯

If you want to preserve the original base filename and simply insert _PyTgt before the .csv extension, then this is the correct approach:

  output_name = file_name.replace(".csv", "_PyTgt.csv")
  
Example:

  *Input: "Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2_PySrc.csv"
  *Output: "Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2_PySrc_PyTgt.csv"

Updated Line in Context:
  
  output_name = file_name.replace(".csv", "_PyTgt.csv")
  output_path = output_dir / output_name

This is useful if you want to:

Preserve the original name entirely

Indicate the file was processed (_PyTgt) without losing original context

Let me know if you’d like a version that uses Path.stem and Path.with_name() instead — a bit more elegant and avoids multiple .replace() calls.

##Tim
I'm good, thank you!!

#ChatGPT
You're very welcome, Tim! 🙌 Glad everything’s clicking into place. If you ever want to level it up further — parallel processing, logs, or file discovery — just holler.

Have fun crunching those CSVs, and talk soon! 🚀🧠📊
